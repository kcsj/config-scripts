* GNU Emacs for the Humanities
- The configuration enables many useful modes and functionality which are not configured/enabled/available in the vanilla version of GNU Emacs; it is primarily designed to aid a non-programmer in using GNU Emacs; it focuses mainly on org-mode and latex configurations. As such, it is mainly directed at people who write documents, though it does include "sane"[fn:subjective] configurations for other components.

- This README file is best read using functionality provided by org-mode.

- This configuration is developed (and running) on GNU Emacs 24.0.92.1 (i486-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.20.1) of 2012-01-06 on doubah, modified by Debian.

** Initiation :: [[file:init.el][init.el]]
- this file initialises the configuration:
  + adds ~/.emacs.d/ to the load-path
  + requires common-lisp package
  + sets custom configuration file
  + requires specific configuration files, a brief description of each module is provided in the following sections[fn:order-of-evaluation]:
    - *package-config*
    - *appearance-config*
    - *general-config*
    - *key-bindings-config*
    - *programming-config*
    - *org-config*
    - *latex-config*
    - *erc-config*
    - *gnus-config*
  + starts the GNU Emacs server

** Package Management :: [[file:config-el/package-config.el][package-config.el]]

* Footnotes

[fn:ELPA] GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archiver.

[fn:auto-setup] This still needs to be correctly configured.

[fn:subjective] Obviously this is going to be subjective. This configuration presented here is very much based around /my/ preferences.

[fn:requires-zenburn] This *requires* the zenburn theme as an outside extra (available from ELPA).

[fn:order-of-evaluation] The order these files are listed in is the order they are included in. This ordering may (or may not) be necessary.

* GNU Emacs Configuration
- This is an attempt at the full blown "GNU Emacs as an Operating System" configuration. Not all of the configuration needs to be used[fn:configuration-note], but a lot of it is recommended.

- This configuration enables many useful modes and functionality which are not configured/enabled/available in the vanilla version of GNU Emacs
- This configuration is a full-blown "emacs is an operating system" setup; this extra functionality is easily configured
- This configuration optionally includes functionality for the following "external"[fn:external] operations:
  + ERC :: an IRC client for GNU Emacs
  + GNUS :: a mail and newsreader client for GNU Emacs
  + Dired :: a file system browser for GNU Emacs
  + eshell :: a shell emulator for GNU Emacs
  + package :: an emacs-lisp package manager
  + package-manager :: a front-end to the system package manager

** TODO This project is based on the idea available from Eric Schulte at [[http://eschulte.me/emacs-starter-kit/starter-kit.html][Emacs Starter Kit]] to turn the dot file setup into an org-file setup.

# TODO: create a "literate" dot emacs initialisation file
# run org-babel on start ...
# TODO: this is more like the initiation file for the aforementioned project, create a proper "README" file

** GNU Emacs Version
- This configuration is developed (and running) on GNU Emacs 24.1.50.1 (i486-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.20.1)
 of 2012-05-03 on cw-bkp0, modified by Debian.

** Initiation :: [[file:init.el][init.el]]
- this file initialises the configuration:
  + adds ~/.emacs.d/ to the load-path
  + requires common-lisp package
  + sets custom configuration file
  + requires specific configuration files, a brief description of each module is provided in the following sections[fn:order-of-evaluation]:
    - *package-config*
    - *appearance-config*
    - *general-config*
    - *key-bindings-config*
    - *programming-config*
    - *org-config*

  + starts the GNU Emacs server

* Footnotes

[fn:ELPA] GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archiver.

[fn:auto-setup] This still needs to be correctly configured.

[fn:subjective] Obviously this is going to be subjective. This configuration presented here is very much based around /my/ preferences.

[fn:requires-zenburn] This *requires* the zenburn theme as an outside extra (available from ELPA).

[fn:order-of-evaluation] The order these files are listed in is the order they are included in. This ordering may (or may not) be necessary.

[fn:external] The word "external" in this context means something like "acting outside the traditional scope of a text-editor".

[fn:configuration-note] This should be verified.

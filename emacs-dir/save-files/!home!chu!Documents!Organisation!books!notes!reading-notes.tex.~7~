\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}

This document comprises the notes of the major philosophical texts (books or papers) I have read during my time as a philosophy student at the \emph{Australian National University}.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Readers wallow in their own aura. Any influence that comes from the words that they are scanning comes from within. If they form a belief from those words, they are comfortable in understanding how they linked towards that belief.}
\end{quote}

\subsection{On Sense and Reference}
\label{sec-3_1}


\begin{itemize}
\item Gottlob Frege
\item According to Frege, sense and reference are two different aspects of the meaning of at least some kinds of terms.
\item Roughly, a term's reference is the object it refers to and its sense is the way in which it refers to that object.
\end{itemize}
\section{Example Logic}
\label{sec-4}

If $\phi \models \psi$ then $\phi \vdash \psi$

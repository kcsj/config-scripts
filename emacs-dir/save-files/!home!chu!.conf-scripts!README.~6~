* Configuration Files
- This directory houses all configuration files.
- The main purpose is to have everything in one nice location.
- Then just provide a symlink from here to the appropriate files.

** TODO Create a bash script which will automatically symlink the files from this directory to their correct locations.
- The symlink command is: "ln -s <src> <dest>"
- Example: "cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/bashrc .bashrc"
  	   The "cd;" command just makes sure we are at /home/<user>


* Commands for symlink'ing are:
- KEY: F = File, D = Directory, C = Command

- F: ~/.conf-scripts/emacs         (then symlink back to ~/.emacs)
- C: cd; ln -s ~/.conf-scripts/emacs .emacs [DONE]

- D: ~/.conf-scripts/emacs-dir/    (then symlink back to ~/.emacs.d)
- C: cd; ln -s ~/.conf-scripts/emacs-dir/ .emacs.d

- F: ~/.conf-scripts/bashrc        (then symlink back to ~/.bashrc)
- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/bashrc .bashrc [DONE]

- F: ~/.conf-scripts/screenrc      (then symlink back to ~/.screenrc)
- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/screenrc .screenrc [DONE]

- F: ~/.conf-scripts/muttrc        (then symlink back to ~/.muttrc)
- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/muttrc .muttrc [DONE]

- F: ~/.conf-scripts/stumpwmrc     (then symlink back to ~/.stumpwmrc)

- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/mutt-dir/ .mutt [DONE]

- D: ~/.conf-scripts/irssi-dir/    (then symlink back to ~/.irssi)
- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/irssi-dir/ .irssi [DONE]

- D: ~/.conf-scripts/aptitude-dir/ (then symlink back to ~/.aptitude)
- C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/aptitude-dir .aptitude [DONE]

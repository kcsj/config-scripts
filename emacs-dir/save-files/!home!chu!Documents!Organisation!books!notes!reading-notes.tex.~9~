This document comprises the notes of the major texts (books or papers) I have read during my time as a joint philosophy and computer science student at the \emph{Australian National University}.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Readers wallow in their own aura. Any influence that comes from the words that they are scanning comes from within. If they form a belief from those words, they are comfortable in understanding how they linked towards that belief.}

\subsubsection*{On Sense and Reference by Gottlob Frege}
\label{sec-3_1_1}

According to Frege, sense and reference are two different aspects of the meaning of at least some kinds of terms.

Roughly, a term's reference is the object it refers to and its sense is the way in which it refers to that object.

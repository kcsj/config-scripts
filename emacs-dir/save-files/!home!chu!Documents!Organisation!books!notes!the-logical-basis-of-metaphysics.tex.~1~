\section*{Chapter 1: Metaphysical Disputes Over Realism}
\label{sec-1}

The starting point of philosophy has to be an analysis of the \emph{fundamental structure} of our thoughts.

With logic we can model the concept of human thought and the central concern of logic is with \emph{inference}, but there can be no analysis of inferences without a prior analysis of the structure of the statements which serve as the premises and conclusion.

Dummett draws distinctions between \emph{realist} and \emph{anti-realist} perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the context of \emph{mathematics}, a realist (or \emph{platonist}) believes that propositions describe (either truly or falsely) an abstract realm which exists independently of our physical reality. In this context, anti-realism takes a variety of flavours; on the one hand \emph{formalists} deny that there are any genuine propositions at all; only the sentences which bare a formal resemblance to propositions, which we manipulate with rules governed by some deductive apparatus reflecting the operations of ordinary, meaningful propositions. On the other hand, \emph{constructivists}, retain a somewhat internal realism, accordingly propositions \emph{do} exist, but only insofar as they relate to our own mental operations.
\item In the context of the \emph{mind}, a realist advocates the view that an individuals observable behaviour is \emph{evidence} of the individuals inner-states; their beliefs, desires, purposes and feelings. An anti-realist would adopt a form of \emph{behaviourism}, whereby ascribing to an individual a mental state (a belief, desire, etc) or attributing them a physical state (such as a pain or other sensation) is simply to say something about the \emph{pattern} of their behaviour.
\item In the context of the \emph{natural sciences} (in particular physics), a realist believes that science \emph{progressively} uncovers what the world is like in itself, explaining in the process why we see things the way we do. The anti-realist equivalent here is an \emph{instrumentalist} who simply regards the theoretical entities as useful fictions, enabling us to predict observable events.
\item In the context of time this distinction is quite significant \ldots{}
\end{itemize}

Dummett has used these examples to highlight the fact (and develop his argument) that classical orthodox logic is limited in explaining these perspectives - its natural appeal to a bivalent truth-domain is its down-fall - and Dummett \emph{wants} a formal language to model these perspectives. In particular, Dummett is interested in exposing a theory of \emph{meaning}, to do so requires an absolute rigour which is only present in terms of a deductive formal system.

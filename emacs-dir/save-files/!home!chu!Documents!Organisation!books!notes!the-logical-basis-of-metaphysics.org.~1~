The Logical Basis of Metaphysics by Michael Dummett: Reading Notes

#+AUTHOR: Matthew Ball
#+DATE: 2011

* Chapter 1: Metaphysical Disputes Over Realism 
The starting point of philosophy has to be an analysis of the /fundamental structure/ of our thoughts.

With logic we can model the concept of human thought and the central concern of logic is with /inference/, but there can be no analysis of inferences without a prior analysis of the structure of the statements which serve as the premises and conclusion.

Dummett draws distinctions between /realist/ and /anti-realist/ perspectives:
- In the context of /mathematics/, a realist (or /platonist/) believes that propositions describe (either truly or falsely) an abstract realm which exists independently of our physical reality. In this context, anti-realism takes a variety of flavours; on the one hand /formalists/ deny that there are any genuine propositions at all; only the sentences which bare a formal resemblance to propositions, which we manipulate with rules governed by some deductive apparatus reflecting the operations of ordinary, meaningful propositions. On the other hand, /constructivists/, retain a somewhat internal realism, accordingly propositions /do/ exist, but only insofar as they relate to our own mental operations.

- In the context of the /mind/, a realist advocates the view that an individuals observable behaviour is /evidence/ of the individuals inner-states; their beliefs, desires, purposes and feelings. An anti-realist would adopt a form of /behaviourism/, whereby ascribing to an individual a mental state (a belief, desire, etc) or attributing them a physical state (such as a pain or other sensation) is simply to say something about the /pattern/ of their behaviour.

- In the context of the /natural sciences/ (in particular physics), a realist believes that science /progressively/ uncovers what the world is like in itself, explaining in the process why we see things the way we do. The anti-realist equivalent here is an /instrumentalist/ who simply regards the theoretical entities as useful fictions, enabling us to predict observable events.

- In the context of time this distinction is quite significant ...

Dummett has used these examples to highlight the fact (and develop his argument) that classical orthodox logic is limited in explaining these perspectives - its natural appeal to a bivalent truth-domain is its down-fall - and Dummett /wants/ a formal language to model these perspectives. In particular, Dummett is interested in exposing a theory of /meaning/, to do so requires an absolute rigour which is only present in terms of a deductive formal system.

child enum: alice, boris, claire, david.


#functions#
age: child -> int {all_different}.
beans: child -> int {all_different}.


#clauses#
% restrictions
age(x) > 5 AND age(x) < 10.
beans(x) > 0 AND beans(x) < 5.

% alice's age plus her beans is the same as boris's age plus his beans
age(alice) + beans(alice) = age(boris) + beans(boris).

% claire's age is two more than the number of alice's beans
age(claire) = beans(alice) + 2.

% alice's age is equal to the number of beans she and claire have altogether
age(alice) = beans(alice) + beans(claire).

===================
Configuration Files
===================
- This directory houses all configuration files.
- The main purpose is to have everything in one nice location.
- Then just provide a symlink from here to the appropriate files.

- TODO: Create a bash script which will automatically symlink the
  	files from this directory to their correct locations.

- The symlink command is: "ln -s <src> <dest>"
- Example: "cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/bashrc .bashrc"
  	   The "cd;" command just makes sure we are at /home/<user>

- List of files to by symlink'd are:
- KEY: F = File, D = Directory, C = Command

+ F: ~/.conf-scripts/emacs         (then symlink back to ~/.emacs)
+ D: ~/.conf-scripts/emacs-dir/    (then symlink back to ~/.emacs.d)

+ F: ~/.conf-scripts/bashrc        (then symlink back to ~/.bashrc)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/bashrc .bashrc

+ F: ~/.conf-scripts/screenrc      (then symlink back to ~/.screenrc)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/screenrc .screenrc

+ F: ~/.conf-scripts/muttrc        (then symlink back to ~/.muttrc)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/muttrc .muttrc

+ D: ~/.conf-scripts/mutt-dir/     (then symlink back to ~/.mutt)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/mutt-dir/ .mutt

+ D: ~/.conf-scripts/irssi-dir/    (then symlink back to ~/.irssi)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/irssi-dir/ .irssi [DONE]

+ D: ~/.conf-scripts/aptitude-dir/ (then symlink back to ~/.aptitude)
+ C: cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/aptitude-dir .aptitude [DONE]

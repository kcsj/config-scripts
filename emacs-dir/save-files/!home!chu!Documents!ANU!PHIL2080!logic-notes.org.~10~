** Section 1
*** Introduction
Logic has essentially to do with reasoning and truth.
**** Inference, Truth and Validity
The fundamental focus of logic is on /inference/ or /argument/.\\

The premises of an argument are supposed to lend rational support to the conclusion in the sense that anyone who accepts the premises and is faced with the argument must, on pain of irrationality, accept the conclusion.\\

Logic investigates the abstract conditions of rationality by classifying and studying /forms/ of argument.\\

There is a difference between /validity/ and /truth/: sentences (statements, propositions, assumptions, etc.\) are true or false; arguments (inferences, passages of reasoning) are valid or invalid.\\

To say that an argument is valid means that it is /impossible/ for its premises to be true and its conclusion false. Conversely, an argument is invalid if there is a way for its premises to be true and its conclusion false.
**** Inference in the Abstract
Validity of inferences or potential inferences is a /relation/ between premises and conclusion. This is a relation of /logical consequence/. Important properties /any/ relation of logical consequence defined over any language have are:
***** *Reflexivity*:
$X \vdash A$ if $A$ is a member of $X$. In particular $A \vdash A$. This is obviously valid: if $A$ is in the database $X$ then the query $A$ succeeds without requiring any inference steps. There is no way for everything in $X$ to be true without $A$ being true if $A$ happens to be one of the things in $X$.
***** *Monotonicity*:
If $X \vdash A$ then for any bigger set $Y$ of which $X$ is a subset, $Y \vdash A$. This means that whatever follows from just some of the assumptions or data follows from the set, or in other words that adding more information cannot destroy any inferences.
***** *Transitivity*:
If $X \vdash A$ for /every/ $A$ in $Y$, and if $Y \vdash B$, then $X \vdash B$. This is a familiar idea: if you can derive some lemmas from the axioms of a theory, and then derive a theorem from the lemmas, you can chain the arguments together to obtain a derivation of the theorem from the axioms. This important principle is often called "cut" in the literature of proof theory.
*** Connectives
Every occurrence of a connective in a formula has a /scope/. Its scope is defined to be the shortest formula (or subformula) in which that occurrence lies.

*** Identity
Extending first-order logic with the ability to describe things as identical (or different). To do this we add the relation of /equality/ or $=$ - this symbolises a relation, the trivial relation which everything has to itself and nothing has to anything else.\\

Identical is meant here in the strict sense of "one and the same" - not just "exactly similar".\\

Do not confuse the "is" of identity (as in "Hesperus /is/ Phosphorus") with the copula, or "is" of predication. In the latter, the use of "is" is as the application of an object to its predicate (as in "Tasmania is no place for the feint-hearted" expressed for instance as $Ft$). In the former, the use of "is" is used to assert that two objects are in fact not distinct, but share the same /reference/.\\

The addition of a notation for identity has greatly increased the expressive power of (the limited language of) first-order logic. Without identity we can formalise, for example, "Ted is running" as $Rt$, and claims such as "someone runs faster than Ted" as $\exists x Fxt$ but not much else in the limited vocabulary. /With/ identity though, we can say:\\

"Ted alone is running" as $Rt \land (\forall x\{Rx\})x = t$.

"Everyone other than Ted is running" as $(\forall x\{x \ne t\})Rx$.

"Ted is the fastest" as $(\forall x\{x \ne t\})Ftx$.

"There is more than one runner" as $(\exists x\{Rx\})(\exists y\{Ry\})x \ne y$.\\

In English, adjectives which admit of degrees give rise to both comparative and superlative forms. The comparative form may be formalised as a two-place relation between objects, and thus the logic of comparatives can be studied as a subject in its own right. The superlative form is systematically related to the comparative form. To express this relationship we need to be able to say "other", for which we are able to use "$\ne$". Thus the identity symbol yields a reduction of the logic of superlatives to that of the comparative which in turn can be represented in the calculus of relations. This effect is /explanatory/ and a conceptual simplification.\\

Without identity we cannot talk of the quantity of objects which satisfy some problem beyond "there is one" or "there is many". With the addition of identity to our language, we can easily model the fact that two (or indeed, any distinct number of) objects satisfy some property. In this way, we are able to more easily speak of /existence/.\\

Generally, to say that there are more then $n$ (i.e. at least $n+1$) $F$'s:

$(\forall x_1)\ldots(\forall x_n)(\exists y\{Fy\})(x_1 \ne y \land \ldots \land x_n \ne y)$

*** Definite Descriptions
"The $F$ is $G$"

** Section 8
*** Relations
The language of first-order logic enables us to represent /relations/ (using predicate symbols) with any finite number of arguments. This allows us to model potential relationships between two or more objects even when these cannot be decomposed into monadic properties of those objects.\\

There are several important properties a relation may (or may not) satisfy, which we can express in the vocabulary of first-order logic. We say that a relation $R$ is:

**** *Reflexive*:
If everything bears relation $R$ to /itself/. In our first-order language this can be expressed as: $\forall x(Rxx)$. For instance: $\subseteq$ is reflexive (all members of a set $s$ are members of $s$), but $<$ us not (no ordered-element is less than itself).

**** *Irreflexive*:
If nothing bears relation $R$ to itself: $\forall x\neg Rxx$. For instance, $<$ is irreflexive because no ordered-element can be less than itself.

**** *Symmetric*:
If the relation is reversible: $\forall x \forall y(Rxy \to Ryx)$.

**** *Asymmetric*:
If the relation is irreversible: $\forall x \forall y(Rxy \to \neg Ryx)$. Again, $<$ is asymmetric (i.e. if $x$ is less than $y$, then $y$ is *not* less than $x$).

**** *Transitivity*:
If $\forall x \forall y \forall y((Rxy \land Ryz) \to Rxz)$.

\chapter{Formal Systems}
\label{cha:formal-systems}
A formal system (or \emph{logical calculus}) consists of a formal language, and a set of inference rules, which are used to derive (or conclude) an expression from one or more other premises that are antecedently supposed (axioms) or derived (theorems). The axioms and rules may be called a deductive apparatus. A formal system may be formulated and studied for its intrinsic properties, or it may be intended as a description (i.e.\ a model) of external phenomena.\\

Of particular interest here, is the notion of a \emph{logical system}; a logical system or, for short, logic, is a formal system together with a form of semantics, usually in the form of model-theoretic interpretation, which assigns truth values to sentences of the formal language, that is, formulae that contain no free variables. A logic is sound if all sentences that can be derived are true in the interpretation, and complete if, conversely, all true sentences can be derived.

\section{Historical Development}
\label{sec:historical-development}
The logico-deductive method whereby conclusions (new knowledge) follow from premises (old knowledge) through the application of sound arguments (syllogisms, rules of inference), was developed by the ancient Greeks, and has become the core principle of modern mathematics. Tautologies excluded, nothing can be deduced if nothing is assumed. Axioms and postulates are the basic assumptions underlying a given body of deductive knowledge. They are accepted without demonstration. All other assertions (theorems, if we are talking about mathematics) must be proven with the aid of these basic assumptions. However, the interpretation of mathematical knowledge has changed from ancient times to the modern, and consequently the terms axiom and postulate hold a slightly different meaning for the present day mathematician, than they did for Aristotle and Euclid.\\

The ancient Greeks considered geometry as just one of several sciences, and held the theorems of geometry on par with scientific facts. As such, they developed and used the logico-deductive method as a means of avoiding error, and for structuring and communicating knowledge. Aristotle's posterior analytics is a definitive exposition of the classical view.\\

An ``axiom'', in classical terminology, referred to a self-evident assumption common to many branches of science. A good example would be the assertion that
\begin{quote}
  \emph{When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.}\\
\end{quote}

At the foundation of the various sciences lay certain additional hypotheses which were accepted without proof. Such a hypothesis was termed a postulate. While the axioms were common to many sciences, the postulates of each particular science were different. Their validity had to be established by means of real-world experience. Indeed, Aristotle warns that the content of a science cannot be successfully communicated, if the learner is in doubt about the truth of the postulates.\\

The classical approach is well illustrated by Euclid's Elements, where a list of postulates is given (common-sensical geometric facts drawn from our experience), followed by a list of ``common notions'' (very basic, self-evident assertions).\\

\textbf{Postulates}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It is possible to draw a straight line from any point to any other point.
  \item It is possible to extend a line segment continuously in a straight line.
  \item It is possible to describe a circle with any center and any radius.
  \item It is true that all right angles are equal to one another.
  \item (``Parallel postulate'') It is true that, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, intersect on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Common Notions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another.
  \item If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.
  \item If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
  \item Things which coincide with one another are equal to one another.
  \item The whole is greater than the part.
\end{enumerate}

A lesson learned by mathematics in the last 150 years is that it is useful to strip the meaning away from the mathematical assertions (axioms, postulates, propositions, theorems) and definitions. One must concede the need for primitive notions, or undefined terms or concepts, in any study. Such abstraction or formalization makes mathematical knowledge more general, capable of multiple different meanings, and therefore useful in multiple contexts. Alessandro Padoa, Mario Pieri, and Giuseppe Peano were pioneers in this movement.\\

Structuralist mathematics goes further, and develops theories and axioms (e.g. field theory, group theory, topology, vector spaces) without any particular application in mind. The distinction between an ``axiom'' and a ``postulate'' disappears. The postulates of Euclid are profitably motivated by saying that they lead to a great wealth of geometric facts. The truth of these complicated facts rests on the acceptance of the basic hypotheses. However, by throwing out Euclid's fifth postulate we get theories that have meaning in wider contexts, hyperbolic geometry for example. We must simply be prepared to use labels like “line” and “parallel” with greater flexibility. The development of hyperbolic geometry taught mathematicians that postulates should be regarded as purely formal statements, and not as facts based on experience.\\

When mathematicians employ the axioms of a field, the intentions are even more abstract. The propositions of field theory do not concern any one particular application; the mathematician now works in complete abstraction. There are many examples of fields; field theory gives correct knowledge about them all.\\

It is not correct to say that the axioms of field theory are “propositions that are regarded as true without proof.” Rather, the field axioms are a set of constraints. If any given system of addition and multiplication satisfies these constraints, then one is in a position to instantly know a great deal of extra information about this system.\\

Modern mathematics formalizes its foundations to such an extent that mathematical theories can be regarded as mathematical objects, and logic itself can be regarded as a branch of mathematics. Frege, Russell, Poincar\'{e}, Hilbert, and G\"{o}del are some of the key figures in this development.\\

In the modern understanding, a set of axioms is any collection of formally stated assertions from which other formally stated assertions follow by the application of certain well-defined rules. In this view, logic becomes just another formal system. A set of axioms should be consistent; it should be impossible to derive a contradiction from the axiom. A set of axioms should also be non-redundant; an assertion that can be deduced from other axioms need not be regarded as an axiom.\\

It was the early hope of modern logicians that various branches of mathematics, perhaps all of mathematics, could be derived from a consistent collection of basic axioms. An early success of the formalist program was Hilbert's formalization of Euclidean geometry, and the related demonstration of the consistency of those axioms.\\

In a wider context, there was an attempt to base all of mathematics on Cantor's set theory. Here the emergence of Russell's paradox, and similar antinomies of naive set theory raised the possibility that any such system could turn out to be inconsistent.\\

The formalist project suffered a decisive setback, when in 1931 G\"{o}del showed that it is possible, for any sufficiently large set of axioms (Peano's axioms, for example) to construct a statement whose truth is independent of that set of axioms. As a corollary, G\"{o}del proved that the consistency of a theory like Peano arithmetic is an unprovable assertion within the scope of that theory.\\

It is reasonable to believe in the consistency of Peano arithmetic because it is satisfied by the system of natural numbers, an infinite but intuitively accessible formal system. However, at present, there is no known way of demonstrating the consistency of the modern Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for set theory. The axiom of choice, a key hypothesis of this theory, remains a very controversial assumption. Furthermore, using techniques of forcing (Cohen) one can show that the continuum hypothesis (Cantor) is independent of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms. Thus, even this very general set of axioms cannot be regarded as the definitive foundation for mathematics.

\section{Necessary and Sufficient Conditions}
\label{sec:necessary-sufficient-conditions}
The words \emph{necessity} and \emph{sufficiency} refer to the implicational relationships between statements. The assertion that one statement is a necessary and sufficient condition of another means that the former statement is true if and only if the latter is true.
\begin{itemize}
  \item A necessary condition of a statement must be satisfied for the statement to be true. Formally, a statement $P$ is a necessary condition of a statement $Q$ if $Q$ implies $P$. For example in order for it to be true that John is a bachelor it is necessary that it be also true that he is 1. unmarried and that 2. he be male - those are the necessary conditions for the statement ``John is a bachelor'' to be true. Or for the whole numbers greater than two, being odd is necessary to being prime, since two is the only whole number that is both even and prime.
  \item A sufficient condition is one that, if satisfied, assures the statement's truth. Formally, a statement $P$ is a sufficient condition of a statement $Q$ if $P$ implies $Q$. For example stating that ``John is a bachelor'' implies that John is male. So knowing that it is true that John is a bachelor is sufficient in order to know that it is also true that he is a male. A number's being divisible by $4$ is sufficient (but not necessary) for its being even, but being divisible by $2$ is both sufficient and necessary.
\end{itemize}

A condition can be either necessary or sufficient without being the other. For instance, being a mammal ($P$) is necessary but not sufficient to being human ($Q$), and that a number $q$ is rational ($P$) is sufficient but not necessary to $q$'s being a real number ($Q$) (since there are real numbers which are not rational). A condition can be both necessary and sufficient. For example, at present, ``today is the Fourth of July'' is a necessary and sufficient condition for ``today is Independence Day in the United States.'' Similarly, a necessary and sufficient condition for invertibility of a matrix $M$ is that $M$ have a nonzero determinant.

\subsection{Relationship Between Necessity and Sufficiency}
\label{sec:relationship-between-necessity-sufficiency}
Mathematically speaking, necessity and sufficiency are \emph{dual} to one another. For any statements $P$ and $Q$, the assertion that ``$P$ is necessary for $Q$'' is equivalent to the assertion that ``$Q$ is sufficient for $P$''. Another facet of this duality is that conjunctions of necessary conditions may achieve sufficiency, while disjunctions of sufficient conditions may achieve necessity. For a third facet, identify every mathematical predicate $P$ with the set ${\cal{S}}(P)$ of objects for which $P$ holds true; then asserting the necessity of $P$ for $Q$ is equivalent to claiming that ${\cal{S}}(P)$ is a superset of ${\cal{S}}(Q)$, while asserting the sufficiency of $P$ for $Q$ is equivalent to claiming that ${\cal{S}}(P)$ is a subset of ${\cal{S}}(Q)$.

\subsection{Material Equivalence}
\label{sec:material-equivalence}
To say that $P$ is necessary and sufficient for $Q$ is to say two things, that $P$ is necessary for $Q$ and that $P$ is sufficient for $Q$. Of course, it may instead be understood to say a different two things, namely that each of $P$ and $Q$ is necessary for the other. And it may be understood in a third equivalent way: as saying that each is sufficient for the other. One may summarize any - and thus all - of these cases by the statement ``$P$ if and only if $Q$'', which is denoted by $P \leftrightarrow Q$.\\

The assertion of ``if and only if'' is a \emph{biconditional} logical connective between statements. The result is that the truth of either one of the connected statements requires the truth of the other (i.e.\ either both statements are true, or both are false). It is controversial whether the connective thus defined is properly rendered by the English ``if and only if'', with its pre-existing meaning. Of course, there is nothing to stop us stipulating that we may read this connective as ``only if and if'', although this may lead to confusion.

\section{Structure of Formal Systems}
\label{sec:structure-formal-systems}
Each formal system has a (formal) language, which is composed of primitive (or atomic) symbols. These symbols act on certain rules of formation and are developed by inference from a set of axioms. The system thus consists of any number of formulas built up through finite combinations of the primitive symbols - combinations that are formed from the axioms in accordance with the stated rules.\\

Formal systems (in mathematics) consist of the following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item A finite set of \emph{symbols} (i.e.\ the alphabet), that can be used for constructing formulas (i.e.\ finite strings of symbols).
  \item A \emph{grammar}, which tells how well-formed formulas (abbreviated wff) are constructed out of the symbols in the alphabet. It is usually required that there be a decision procedure for deciding whether a formula is well formed or not.
  \item A set of \emph{axioms} or axiom schemata: each axiom must be a wff.
  \item A set of \emph{inference} rules.
\end{enumerate}

A formal system is said to be recursive (i.e.\ effective) if the set of axioms and the set of inference rules are decidable sets or semidecidable sets, according to context.\\

As previously mentioned, there are three fundamental elements of a formal system; these are the \emph{axioms} of the system, the associated \emph{deductive reasoning}, and the \emph{theorems} of the formal system. All three of these elements will be further expanded in the coming chapters, but they will be briefly explained here.

\subsection{Axioms}
\label{sec:axioms}
In traditional logic, an axiom or postulate is a proposition that is not proved or demonstrated but considered to be either self-evident, or subject to necessary decision. Therefore, its truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent) truths.\\

In mathematics, the term axiom is used in two related but distinguishable senses: ``logical axioms'' and ``non-logical axioms''. In both senses, an axiom is any mathematical statement that serves as a starting point from which other statements are logically derived. Unlike theorems, axioms (unless redundant) cannot be derived by principles of deduction, nor are they demonstrable by mathematical proofs, simply because they are starting points; there is nothing else from which they logically follow (otherwise they would be classified as theorems).\\

\emph{Logical axioms} are usually statements that are taken to be universally true (e.g.\ A and B implies A), while \emph{non-logical axioms} (e.g.\ a + b = b + a) are actually defining properties for the domain of a specific mathematical theory (such as arithmetic). When used in the latter sense, ``axiom,'' ``postulate'', and ``assumption'' may be used interchangeably. In general, a non-logical axiom is not a self-evident truth, but rather a formal logical expression used in deduction to build a mathematical theory. To axiomatize a system of knowledge is to show that its claims can be derived from a small, well-understood set of sentences (the axioms).\\

The logical axioms are the fundamental assumptions of any formal system; they are often thought of as the obvious, necessary truths of a formal system. Axioms define a base case structure of the formal system under consideration, these are the primitive statements of a system which allow complex-statements to be formed. Each set of axioms is understood to satisfy the following four properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Consistent} - the same set of axioms should always produce the same answer.
  \item \emph{Independent} - it should not be possible to deduce an axiom from another axiom; they are self-evident truths.
  \item \emph{Simple} - should be as clear as possible for easy comprehension.
  \item \emph{Fruitful} - have a diverse set of applications in terms of theorems produced.
\end{enumerate}

The problem with axioms lies in the assumption that axioms are actually true, since there is no method of verification besides ``it's obvious''. This is a rather obvious philosophical question which will be discussed in the final chapter of this book.

\subsubsection{Logical Axioms}
\label{sec:logical-axioms}
These are certain formulas in a formal language that are universally valid, that is, formulas that are satisfied by every assignment of values. Usually one takes as logical axioms at least some minimal set of tautologies that is sufficient for proving all tautologies in the language; in the case of predicate logic more logical axioms than that are required, in order to prove logical truths that are not tautologies in the strict sense.

\subsubsection{Non-logical Axioms}
\label{sec:non-logical-axioms}
Non-logical axioms are formulas that play the role of theory-specific assumptions. Reasoning about two different structures, for example the natural numbers and the integers, may involve the same logical axioms; the non-logical axioms aim to capture what is special about a particular structure (or set of structures, such as groups). Thus non-logical axioms, unlike logical axioms, are not tautologies. Another name for a non-logical axiom is postulate.\\

Almost every modern mathematical theory starts from a given set of non-logical axioms, and it was thought that in principle every theory could be axiomatized in this way and formalized down to the bare language of logical formulas. This turned out to be impossible and proved to be quite an arduous task; however recently this approach has been resurrected in the form of \emph{neo-logicism}.\\

Non-logical axioms are often simply referred to as axioms in mathematical discourse. This does not mean that it is claimed that they are true in some absolute sense. For example, in some groups, the group operation is commutative, and this can be asserted with the introduction of an additional axiom, but without this axiom we can do quite well developing (the more general) group theory, and we can even take its negation as an axiom for the study of non-commutative groups.\\

Thus, an axiom is an elementary basis for a formal logic system that together with the rules of inference define a deductive system.

\subsection{Deductive Reasoning}
\label{sec:deductive-reasoning}
A deductive system consists of a set $\Lambda$ of logical axioms, a set $\Sigma$ of non-logical axioms, and a set $\{(\Gamma, \phi)\}$ of \emph{rules of inference}. A desirable property of a deductive system is that it be complete. A system is said to be complete if, for all formulas $\phi$,
\begin{equation}
  \text{if } \Sigma \models \phi \text{ then } \Sigma \vdash \phi
\end{equation}

That is, for any statement that is a logical consequence of $\Sigma$ there actually exists a deduction of the statement from $\Sigma$. This is sometimes expressed as ``everything that is true is provable'', but it must be understood that ``true'' here means ``made true by the set of axioms'', and not, for example, ``true in the intended interpretation''. G\"{o}del's completeness theorem establishes the completeness of a certain commonly used type of deductive system.\\

Note that ``completeness'' has a different meaning here than it does in the context of G\"{o}del's first incompleteness theorem, which states that no \emph{recursive, consistent} set of non-logical axioms $\Sigma$ of the Theory of Arithmetic is \emph{complete}, in the sense that there will always exist an arithmetic statement $\psi$ such that neither $\psi$ nor $\neg\psi$ can be proved from the given set of axioms.\\

There is thus, on the one hand, the notion of completeness of a \emph{deductive system} and on the other hand that of completeness of a set of \emph{non-logical axioms}. The completeness theorem and the incompleteness theorem, despite their names, do not contradict one another.

\subsection{Theorems}
\label{sec:theorems}
In mathematics, a theorem is a statement that has been proven on the basis of previously established statements, such as other theorems, and previously accepted statements, such as axioms. The derivation of a theorem is often interpreted as a proof of the truth of the resulting expression, but different deductive systems can yield other interpretations, depending on the meanings of the derivation rules. Theorems have two components, called the hypotheses and the conclusions. The proof of a mathematical theorem is a logical argument demonstrating that the conclusions are a necessary consequence of the hypotheses, in the sense that if the hypotheses are true then the conclusions must also be true, without any further assumptions. The concept of a theorem is therefore fundamentally deductive, in contrast to the notion of a scientific theory, which is empirical.\\

Although they can be written in a completely symbolic form using, for example, propositional calculus, theorems are often expressed in a natural language such as English. The same is true of proofs, which are often expressed as logically organized and clearly worded informal arguments intended to demonstrate that a formal symbolic proof can be constructed. Such arguments are typically easier to check than purely symbolic ones - indeed, many mathematicians would express a preference for a proof that not only demonstrates the validity of a theorem, but also explains in some way why it is obviously true. In some cases, a picture alone may be sufficient to prove a theorem. Because theorems lie at the core of mathematics, they are also central to its aesthetics. Theorems are often described as being ``trivial'', or ``difficult'', or ``deep'', or even ``beautiful''. These subjective judgments vary not only from person to person, but also with time: for example, as a proof is simplified or better understood, a theorem that was once difficult may become trivial. On the other hand, a deep theorem may be simply stated, but its proof may involve surprising and subtle connections between disparate areas of mathematics. ``Fermat's Last Theorem'' is a particularly well-known example of such a theorem.\\

The notion of a theorem is deeply intertwined with the concept of proof. Indeed, theorems are true precisely in the sense that they possess proofs. Therefore, to establish a mathematical statement as a theorem, the existence of a line of reasoning from axioms in the system (and other, already established theorems) to the given statement must be demonstrated.\\

Although the proof is necessary to produce a theorem, it is not usually considered part of the theorem. And even though more than one proof may be known for a single theorem, only one proof is required to establish the theorem's \emph{validity}. The Pythagorean theorem and the law of quadratic reciprocity are contenders for the title of theorem with the greatest number of distinct proofs.\\

Logic, especially in the field of proof theory, considers theorems as statements (called formulas or well-formed formulas) of a formal language. The statements of the language are strings of symbols and may be broadly divided into nonsense and well-formed formulas. A set of deduction rules, also called transformation rules or rules of inference, must be provided. These deduction rules tell exactly when a formula can be derived from a set of premises. The set of well-formed formulas may be broadly divided into theorems and non-theorems. However, according to Hofstadter, a formal system will often simply define all of its well-formed formula as theorems.\\

Different sets of derivation rules give rise to different interpretations of what it means for an expression to be a theorem. Some derivation rules and formal languages are intended to capture mathematical reasoning; the most common examples use first-order logic. Other deductive systems describe term rewriting, such as the reduction rules for $\lambda$-calculus.\\

The definition of theorems as elements of a formal language allows for results in proof theory that study the structure of formal proofs and the structure of provable formulas. The most famous result is G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorem; by representing theorems about basic number theory as expressions in a formal language, and then representing this language within number theory itself, G\"{o}del constructed examples of statements that are neither provable nor disprovable from axiomatizations of number theory.

\section{Metatheory of Formal Systems}
\label{sec:metatheory-formal-systems}
A \emph{metatheory} (or meta-theory) is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory. In other words it is a theory about a theory. Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems.\\

Metatheory belongs to the philosophical specialty of epistemology and metamathematics, as well as being an object of concern to the area in which the individual theory is conceived. The basic objects of study in metalogic are formal languages, formal systems, and their interpretations. The study of interpretation of formal systems is the branch of mathematical logic known as model theory, while the study of deductive apparatus is the branch known as proof theory.\\

Logicians distinguish between

\begin{itemize}
  \item the abstracted form of such sentences and the roles that sentences of that form play in arguments and proofs;
  \item the meanings that must be assigned to such sentences to account for those roles.
\end{itemize}

The former represents their syntactic and proof-theoretic interests, the latter their semantic or truth-theoretic interests.

\subsection{Proof Theory}
\label{sec:proof-theory}
Formal proofs are sequences of well-formed formulas (or wffs). For a wff to qualify as part of a proof, it might either be an axiom or be the product of applying an inference rule on previous wffs in the proof sequence. The last wff in the sequence is recognized as a theorem.\\

The point of view that generating formal proofs is all there is to mathematics is often called \emph{formalism}. David Hilbert founded metamathematics as a discipline for discussing formal systems. Any language that one uses to talk about a formal system is called a metalanguage. The metalanguage may be nothing more than ordinary natural language, or it may be partially formalized itself, but it is generally less completely formalized than the formal language component of the formal system under examination, which is then called the object language, that is, the object of the discussion in question.\\

Once a formal system is given, one can define the set of theorems which can be proved inside the formal system. This set consists of all wffs for which there is a proof. Thus all axioms are considered theorems. Unlike the grammar for wffs, there is no guarantee that there will be a \emph{decision procedure} for deciding whether a given wff is a theorem or not. The notion of theorem just defined should not be confused with theorems about the formal system, which, in order to avoid confusion, are usually called metatheorems.\\

Proof theory is a branch of mathematical logic that represents proofs as formal mathematical objects, facilitating their analysis by mathematical techniques. Proofs are typically presented as inductively-defined data structures such as plain lists, boxed lists, or trees, which are constructed according to the axioms and rules of inference of the logical system. As such, proof theory is syntactic in nature, in contrast to model theory, which is semantic in nature. Together with model theory, axiomatic set theory, and recursion theory, proof theory is one of the so-called four pillars of the foundations of mathematics.\\

Proof theory is important in philosophical logic, where the primary interest is in the idea of a proof-theoretic semantics, an idea which depends upon technical ideas in structural proof theory to be feasible.

\subsection{Model Theory}
\label{sec:model-theory}
In mathematics, model theory is the study of (classes of) mathematical structures such as groups, fields, graphs, or even universes of set theory, using tools from mathematical logic. A structure that gives meaning to the sentences of a formal language is called a model for the language. If a model for a language moreover satisfies a particular sentence or theory (set of sentences), it is called a model of the sentence or theory. Model theory has close ties to algebra and universal algebra.\\

Here, we are interested primarily on finitary first order model theory of infinite structures. Finite model theory, which concentrates on finite structures, diverges significantly from the study of infinite structures in both the problems studied and the techniques used. Model theory in higher-order logics or infinitary logics is hampered by the fact that completeness does not in general hold for these logics. However, a great deal of study has also been done in such languages.\\

Model theory recognises and is intimately concerned with a duality: It examines semantical elements by means of syntactical elements of a corresponding language. To quote the first page of Chang and Keisler (1990):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{universal algebra + logic = model theory.}
\end{itemize}
In a similar way to proof theory, model theory is situated in an area of interdisciplinarity between mathematics, philosophy, and computer science. The most important professional organization in the field of model theory is the Association for Symbolic Logic.\\

An incomplete and somewhat arbitrary subdivision of model theory is into classical model theory, model theory applied to groups and fields, and geometric model theory. A missing subdivision is computable model theory, but this can arguably be viewed as an independent subfield of logic. Examples of early theorems from classical model theory include G\"odel's completeness theorem, the upward and downward L\"owenheim–Skolem theorems, Vaught's two-cardinal theorem, Scott's isomorphism theorem, the omitting types theorem, and the Ryll-Nardzewski theorem. Examples of early results from model theory applied to fields are Tarski's elimination of quantifiers for real closed fields, Ax's theorem on pseudo-finite fields, and Robinson's development of nonstandard analysis. An important step in the evolution of classical model theory occurred with the birth of stability theory (through Morley's theorem on uncountably categorical theories and Shelah's classification program), which developed a calculus of independence and rank based on syntactical conditions satisfied by theories. During the last several decades applied model theory has repeatedly merged with the more pure stability theory. The result of this synthesis is called geometric model theory in this article (which is taken to include o-minimality, for example, as well as classical geometric stability theory). An example of a theorem from geometric model theory is Hrushovski's proof of the Mordell-Lang conjecture for function fields. The ambition of geometric model theory is to provide a geography of mathematics by embarking on a detailed study of definable sets in various mathematical structures, aided by the substantial tools developed in the study of pure model theory.\footnote{Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model\_theory}

\section{Theory of Truth}
\label{sec:theory-truth}
The question of ``what is truth?'' is best understood from an epistemological perspective; to understand what \emph{we} mean when we say ``$x$ is true'' it is first necessary to understand those entities (physical or non-physical) which can be considered as \emph{truth-bearers}.\\

The predicate ``is true'' can be applied to a subject (a propositional argument), according to the \emph{model} of the supplied argument, different characterisations of what it means to be true are found:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Logical truth} - for all variable assignments to the statement, the end result is true.
  \item \emph{Contingent truth} - there exists a variable assignment to the statement which makes the result true.
  \item \emph{Absurdity} - there does not exist a possible variable assignment which makes the statement under consideration true.
\end{enumerate}

This is a very deep field of logic; it is understood and analysed as a metalogic - the logic which exists beyond our propositional arguments. In the past century the analysis of logic has mainly been in the field of metalogic, whether it is re-defining an existing semantics, or showing what problems are decidable/undecidable and tractable/untractable.

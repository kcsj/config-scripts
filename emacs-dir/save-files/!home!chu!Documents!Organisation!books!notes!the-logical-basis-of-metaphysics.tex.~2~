\section*{Chapter 1: Metaphysical Disputes Over Realism}
\label{sec-1}

The starting point of philosophy has to be an analysis of the \emph{fundamental structure} of our thoughts.

With logic we can model the concept of human thought and the central concern of logic is with \emph{inference}, but there can be no analysis of inferences without a prior analysis of the structure of the statements which serve as the premises and conclusion.

Dummett draws distinctions between \emph{realist} and \emph{anti-realist} perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item In the context of \emph{mathematics}, a realist (or \emph{platonist}) believes that propositions describe (either truly or falsely) an abstract realm which exists independently of our physical reality. In this context, anti-realism takes a variety of flavours; on the one hand \emph{formalists} deny that there are any genuine propositions at all; only the sentences which bare a formal resemblance to propositions, which we manipulate with rules governed by some deductive apparatus reflecting the operations of ordinary, meaningful propositions. On the other hand, \emph{constructivists}, retain a somewhat internal realism, accordingly propositions \emph{do} exist, but only insofar as they relate to our own mental operations.
\item In the context of the \emph{mind}, a realist advocates the view that an individuals observable behaviour is \emph{evidence} of the individuals inner-states; their beliefs, desires, purposes and feelings. An anti-realist would adopt a form of \emph{behaviourism}, whereby ascribing to an individual a mental state (a belief, desire, etc) or attributing them a physical state (such as a pain or other sensation) is simply to say something about the \emph{pattern} of their behaviour.
\item In the context of the \emph{natural sciences} (in particular physics), a realist believes that science \emph{progressively} uncovers what the world is like in itself, explaining in the process why we see things the way we do. The anti-realist equivalent here is an \emph{instrumentalist} who simply regards the theoretical entities as useful fictions, enabling us to predict observable events.
\item In the context of time this distinction is quite significant \ldots{}
\end{itemize}

Dummett has used the examples to highlight the fact (and develop his argument) that rejecting realism means rejecting classical orthodox logic. Dummett claims that anti-realist views (in the typical case) have appropriate grounds to reject bivalence, and accordingly reject the \emph{law of the excluded middle}.

The law of the excluded middle is the logical statement $A \lor \neg A$ - either a statement holds, or its negation holds - this form of argument allows one to reason with the \emph{simple constructive dilemma} (i.e. $A \land (B \land \neg B) \vdash A$). When the law of the excluded middle is rejected as invalid, this line of reasoning no longer works.

\begin{quote}
\emph{Those who first clearly grasped [the idea] that rejecting realism entailed rejecting classical logic were the intuitionists, constructive mathematicians of the school of Brouwer}.\footnote{Michael Dummett, \emph{The Logical Basis of Metaphysics}, (Harvard University Press, 1991), p. 9. }
\end{quote}

Dummett argues that if a mathematical statement is true, \emph{only} if we are able to prove said statement, then we have no grounds to assume that \emph{every} mathematical statement is either true or false. This is rejecting bivalence, and as mentioned above, also rejecting the law of the excluded middle. Thus, by employing stricter rules on what counted as a \emph{valid} inference, Brouwer (and others) had created an \emph{intuitionistic logic} - a system of non-classical logic which (obviously) rejects bivalence.

In the context of metaphysics (and perhaps more generally philosophy), we now have a new focus towards a strategy of investigation with some far-fetched consequences for logic. A problem arises when one attempts to answer questions such as ``how does one comprehend the content of this metaphysical doctrine?''.

\section{Introduction}
The central theme of this paper regards an ontology of objects and types; a study of the nature of conception and abstraction. We begin with a discussions of the medieval problem of universals; whether such a concept \emph{exists} independently of the individuals who posses such a quality, or whether they are entirely fabric, just a convenient way of describing some relationship. How this phenomena influences objects should be evident; objects are described as entities which have certain qualities. Some of these qualities are universal to \emph{all} objects, while some are particular to a \emph{specific} object.\\

Some notable names have held the view that abstract objects such as numbers, or universals exist. While some notable philosophers have denied the existence of such theoretical entities, claiming the are instantiated only in the minds of the individual. We call the former ``property realists'' and the latter ``nominalists''. There has been varying degrees of success arguing for either side.\\

The realist approach to universals is an appeal to universals in order to explain the nature of properties and relations. Traditionally a nominalist would deny this requirement. Of course, this division is not quite so clear-cut; property realism comes in a variety of flavours, Platonic, Aristotelian, and Russellian being the major varieties, as one would expect, nominalism also comes in differing forms, predicate nominalism, class nominalism, resemblance nominalism and trope theory being the most common.\\

The beginnings of our modern abstract, formal notation and understanding of objects can be found in the work by Gottlob Frege. Frege attempted to show how the \emph{truths} of modern mathematics could be derived entirely from logic (so one would not have to rely upon the ``pure intuition'' as Kant had argued). To show how this was possible, Frege had to invent modern first-order logic. The dominant notion of logic at the turn of the 20th century was of course Aristotelian which is based on a classical subject-predicate form of grammar, in contrast Frege's logic analysed the structure of sentences relating concepts and objects, allowing for a great deal more expressiveness. It allowed Frege to reason about the concepts of the general and the specific in a formal analysis. While traditional logic would analyze a sentence such as ``all horses are mammals'' by dividing it into the subject, ``all horses,'' and the predicate, ``are mammals,'' Frege analyzed it into the object ``horse'' and the concept ``mammal.''.\\

According to Frege, concepts are functions in the mathematical sense, but applied more broadly. That is, the concept ``mammal'' can be expressed as the function ``$x$ is a
mammal'' where any object can be inserted for $x$. Any function can then mean one of two things: either ``the true'' (e.g. if $x$ is ``my mother'') or ``the false'' (e.g. if $x$ is ``the Eiffel Tower''). This would lead Frege into difficulty, as phrases like ``the concept of a horse'' could be substituted for $x$, and could thus be considered objects.\\

Frege embarked on a journey to remove psychology - and thus subjectivity - from formal analysis. Whereas Kant had distinguished the analytic and the synthetic according to how these judgments were framed in the mind. Frege insisted the analytic/synthetic distinction had nothing to do with psychology, but rather with justification: a judgment that can be justified by means of logic alone is analytic, whereas a judgment that must be justified by referring to the world is synthetic. Effectively, Frege argued that the meaning of sentences has nothing to do with what goes on in the head, and everything to do with their logical structure.\\

In the early 20th century Bertrand Russell had argued that the language we normally use consists solely of descriptions: if I talk about ``the queen of England,'' I am offering a description of a woman I have never met. According to Russell, a full analysis of language will rid propositions of descriptions, by replacing them with objects we are acquainted with. But, the only things we are directly acquainted with are sense data. Thus, all language can ultimately be analyzed down to remarks on present or past sense data with which we are directly acquainted.

\section{Universals and Particulars}
Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, properties, kinds or relations, which can be applied to individuals or particulars, or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. Perhaps the most common cases of universals are typically regarded as abstract objects, although, abstract objects are not necessarily universals.\\

This is the analysis of the quantitative properties and relations which compose an object. These include what are known as \emph{universal} properties; it is a universal property of a ball that it is a sphere, and \emph{existential} properties; it is an \emph{existential} property of a red ball that it is red\footnote{This is not quite the same as the \emph{universal} property of ``redness'' which all red-objects possess.}.\\

To make this notion more formal (which will certainly become clearer later) we can say ``for all $x$, where $x$ is a ball, it is the case that $x$ has the property of being a sphere.'', and ``there exists a $y$, where $y$ is a ball, such that $y$ has the property of being a sphere \emph{and} the property of being red.'' respectively. The difference is in the scope of domain under consideration, in the first case statements consider an \emph{entire} domain, while in the second case it is just one \emph{specific} element from the domain. This will be described more accurately in the coming sub-section on descriptions.\\

According to the metaphysical stance we accept in this paper, when we talk of objects we are really just describing combinations of \emph{sets} of properties. In the case of complex-objects we may describe the possible functional relations between these properties. This brings up an issue at hand, that of \emph{infinite regress}. We are at a point where we are describing \emph{what} makes an object. If you accept what this paper has outlined, you are describing objects as sets of properties; the name of the object just refers to those sets. The issue now becomes how do we describe what constitutes a property? On the outset, a property consist of a predicate-relationship with the object.\\

This is important, because (as we will see) a common technique for proving a statement is to assume the opposite; if we are reasoning universally, the statements become... If we are reasoning existentially, the statements become.

\subsection{Identity}
\emph{What makes an individual a single entity, as opposed to a large number of separate entities working together? What makes one object here the same as another object there?}

\subsection{Abstraction}
Informally, when faced with a problem, a process of abstraction is initiated. This process attempts to highlight the common aspects of the problem with other well-known problems; problems for which we have \emph{known} solutions. It is through a process of visualisation from which we arrive at an abstraction; we model a working system by reducing the system to the conceptual instances that we are familiar with, so that we can understand as much of a physical implementation as possible. The exact details of how this is done, both neuroscientifically and psychologically, are beyond the scope of this paper and irrelevant to the discussion. We are interested in how we metaphysically perceive of objects \emph{a priori}, and consequently how objects are represented to us conceptually.\\

In general, abstraction removes the characteristic specifics and emphasises the general structure of the problem under analysis. This process of abstraction works two ways; not only can we derive models of abstract solutions to complex-systems, we can also understand how a complex-system works through a recursive analysis of an abstraction of the elements involved in the system. Most importantly it is a critical methodology for extracting and analysing smaller, working-components of a complex-system.\\

In everyday language, our notions and accepted applications of objects gives rise to a theory of ``typed'' objects (though the notions of type are \emph{implicit}, it appears English may be a \emph{context-free} language).\footnote{This could be Russell's theory of types.} A type is a subdivision of a particular kind of object. Types share possible relationships with objects, an instantiated object may \emph{have} a type; a ``tennis-ball'' is of type ``ball'', while an abstract object usually \emph{is} a type; a ``ball'' is a general abstract type of the many instances and varieties of balls available. Types gives us expressive strength, we can generate an inheritance-based system with polymorphism from which we develop a hierarchy of types, some inheriting behaviour from others, while others being the atomic building blocks from which everything else is built. As a result of this type-relationship, we are able to describe general functions which operate on a argument-dependent type.\\

This process of abstraction complements our language by describing the very means by which we can evaluate this ``typed''-language; a type is the \emph{general} structure defining characteristic of an object. There exists an object type which is common to \emph{all} objects - this is the abstract notion of ``Object'' and would have the properties ``name'' and ``weight'' (assuming all objects have a weight). Properties themselves have types; in most cases the properties of an object are formed by atomic types. This is not necessary though, a property can also a be complex-object. In this sense, a difference in types can be considered a difference in the \emph{behaviour} of an object.\\

Abstract objects are generally regarded as being outside of space and time, and/or as being causally inert. Thus the question of whether these objects really exist or not, concerns the meaning of existence itself.

\section{Theory of Objects}
This is a study of \emph{objects}, and how we can model environments and relationships. Objects and properties share a crucial relationship, objects themselves just appear to be \emph{proper} names (\emph{see:} descriptions) which refer to some abstract set of properties. Relations form the crux of the abstraction process. They define what behaviour \emph{is} allowed in a system. Understanding the potential uses, mis-uses and limits of formal relationships allows one to not only extend currently existing and known relations, but also to create entirely new formal systems which are \emph{described} by these new relations.\\

Types are just a way of singling out one element from a collection of objects, or quantifying over the entire set.  It is doubtful whether objects themselves exist in the real world, rather there are \emph{things} - physical entities - which exist, and our notion of describing these things is entirely fabric. Instead, an object is an \emph{abstraction} providing a description of these entities which exists in the real world. We conceptualise a physical entity in terms of its constituent components, when combined, these components enable us to reason about what makes an entity $x$ distinct from some other entity $y$. Objects pervade our modern analysis of the world.\\

How are these individual ``objects'' constructed? How can we reason about ``collections'' of these objects? Depending on how one answers these questions, the response will give rise to a theory of types - a necessary result of the abstraction objects provide. The naive theory of \emph{sets} from mathematics provides a reasonable model for describing an object.

\subsection{Abstract and Concrete Objects}
An \emph{abstract} object is an object which does not exist at any particular spatio-temporal position; but rather exists as a \emph{type} of thing (an idea, or abstraction). The type-token distinction identifies that physical objects are tokens of a particular type of thing. In contrast, a concrete object is an instantiation of an abstract object. For instance, the abstract object of a ``human'' is instantiated by the individual ``Socrates''.

\subsection{Attributes and Functions of Objects}
If we think of an object as a structure for interpreting data, an object's attributes are the internal values which the object can manipulate in order to function with the external world.

\subsection{Objects in Thought}
When we attempt to cognitively analyse a physical entity, we analyse the entity as an object composed of further abstractions we \emph{understand}. This enables to look upon the entity under analysis in terms we are already familiar with.

\subsubsection{Modal Objects}
We conceive of objects beyond the physical possibilities of reality of existence. There is a difference, of course, between what could \emph{possibly} exist, what does exist, and what \emph{necessarily} exists. For example: a unicorn might possibly exist, a horse does exist, and it is a necessarily consequence that when we add one with one, we get two.\\

When a \emph{modal} statement with one of the above operators is encountered, it is often difficult to judge the truth-value of the sentence. Indeed, the common response is ``is there a truth-value?'', perhaps implying that the question of existence cannot be handled by our formal logic.

\subsubsection{Bundle Theory}
The bundle theory of object composition was put forward by Bertrand Russell, and can basically be summarised as: objects consist (are made up) of properties (and perhaps other objects in the case of a complex object). This is essentially an appeal to first-order logic, which allows us to model the properties of an object as a predicate applied to some argument. 

\subsection{Objects in Language}
In natural language, when we describe an object, we describe a logical relationship between the subject of a complete, linguistic sentence, and a property that subject possesses. The result of this, is the application of the subject with a predicate. This is a sort of high-level functional application; we pass an object, as a function, to a function which represents the application of the object given as an argument to a predicate, this application function returns a new function which is the result of applying the original object to predicate is the object, or function, returned; this is a purpose of the word ``is'' in natural language. An object is affected by the action described in the \emph{verb} - a verb may be followed by an object that completes the verb's meaning. For instance, in the complete-sentence:\\

\texttt{Dennis wrote a book.}\\

The subject of the sentence is ``Dennis'', while the predicate is ``wrote a book''. The object of the sentence is found by disassembling the predicate. In this case, the object is the ``book'' which Dennis read. While the complete-sentence:\\

\texttt{I read that book.}\\

Has a similar interpretation. Now the subject becomes myself, and the predicate is ``read that book'', referring to an arbitrary book (or indeed the book ``Dennis'' wrote). The object of this sentence is again found by disassembling the predicate and finding the ``book''. The result is, the object of a sentence is not always the same as the subject of a sentence. Indeed, more often then not, I think one will find that the object is not the subject of a sentence. The difference between an object and a subject is entirely contextual; there can be many objects contained within one sentence, while a sentence is usually only \emph{about} one subject.

\subsubsection{Theory of Descriptions}
A \emph{description} represents the subject of a sentence in words. Usually as a result of some sort of analysis, we arrive at a conclusion of what object is indicated by the subject of a sentence under consideration; the statement which follows is a linguistic expression representing the object denoted by the aforementioned subject.\\

One of the first philosophers to provide answers to questions asked about the form of such statements was Bertrand Russell. In his seminal paper ``On Denoting'' Russell introduces a \emph{theory of descriptions}, that is, Russell attempts to show how descriptions could be deconstructed and understand in terms of the constituent components of the denoting phrase in which said description is contained. Russell considers three specific categories of descriptions; these are, the case when a description denotes \emph{nothing}, the case when a description denotes a \emph{definite} article, and the case when a description denotes a class of \emph{indefinite} articles.\\

In general, a description is a statement which represents \emph{something} in words. The vagueness of this description in a sense depends upon the typed-language being described; as long as something is well-typed a description should be able to justify it. The analysis of descriptive terms was spearheaded by Bertrand Russell; who lends two chapters in his text ``Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy'' entirely to the study of the word ``the''. These chapters are representative of:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \emph{Singular terms} - those words or phrases which refer to an individual object. The semantic value of a singular term is the object which it refers to.
  \item \emph{General terms} - those words or phrases which refer to/is true of objects that satisfy some general condition. The semantic value of a general term is the set of objects which satisfy the given condition.
\end{enumerate}

Russell draws a distinction between information with which we are acquainted, and information which we have knowledge about. To quote Russell: ``All thinking has to start from acquaintance; but it succeeds in thinking \emph{about} many things with which we have no acquaintance''\cite{russell-imp}, in saying this, Russell is implying that not all information can be directly inferred from our senses alone, rather the only way to understand some particular phenomena is through denotation. This highlights just how important the concept of a denotational description is.\\

The need for a theory of descriptions comes about as a result of trying to understand the interpretation and \emph{meaning} of the declarative statements which contain denoting phrases. The motivation here is that Russell was interested in formalising the basic concepts of mathematics. In doing so, Russell was able to give potential solutions to the problems of language which Gottlob Frege had highlighted around the turn of the twentieth century. These are:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Co-referring expression (also known as ``Frege's Puzzle'' or the problem of identity); and
  \item Non-referring expressions (also known as the problem of negative existentials).
\end{enumerate}

Russell's theory attempts to explain the semantic structure of the aforementioned phrases. In doing so, he shows how the \emph{logical} form of such statements differs from their respective \emph{grammatical} form.\\

According to Russell, ``Frege's Puzzle'' is deceptive, in that it is not a problem of identity, but rather a contingent statement concerning co-referring expressions, which is really a declaration of a self-evident truth, which applies a property to the individual or object being identified.\\

As Russell's theory tries to explain the \emph{logical} value of expressions, the theory explains non-referring expressions through a conjunction of simpler expressions. When one element of a conjunction is false, the whole statement is false. In this way, a non-referring expression can be understood as a false expression - there simply is no individual or object which makes the statement true.\\

To account for negative existentials, Russell invokes a distinction between what he calls \emph{primary} and \emph{secondary} occurrences of denotational phrases. Russell uses the more precise terms \emph{wide} and \emph{narrow} scope to distinguish between the aforementioned occurrences; this scope distinction regards the modifier which affects only the \emph{subject} of a phrase (in this case, the modifier is applied to the primary occurrence of the phrase), or the modifier which is applied to the \emph{entire} sentence (in this case, the modifier is applied to the secondary occurrence of the phrase). Thus, in the case of negative existentials, Russell's theory ``pulls'' the negative operator out to the front of a sentence. Essentially these statements evaluate to \emph{false} under Russell's theory.

\subsubsection*{Definite Descriptions}
According to Russell's theory, a definite description is the subject of a sentence represented in the form ``the $F$'', where $F$ is understood to be a noun-phrase or a singular, common noun.\\

When a definite description appears in a declarative statement, such as ``the $F$ is $G$'' what is actually being stated is a logical conjunction. This conjunction is to be understood as asserting the following three claims:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The existence of an individual or object $x$ which satisfies the predicate $F$. This is an existence claim; and
  \item Any individual or object $y$ which also satisfies the predicate $F$ is equivalent (in the sense of identity) to the individual or object $x$. This is a uniqueness claim; and
  \item The individual or object which satisfies $F$ also satisfies the predicate $G$. This is a generalisation claim.
\end{enumerate}

Symbolically this is expressed as: $\exists x.(Fx \land (\forall y.Fy \rightarrow y = x) \land Gx)$.\\

A definite description can be proper or improper. A proper definite description applies to a single, unique individual or object (such as ``the first man in space''). While an improper definite description may apply to more than one individual or object (such as ``the man in space''), or the description may refer to nothing at all (such as ``the first man on Mars''). The above analysis applies to proper definite descriptions, improper definite descriptions can be understood as indefinite descriptions, or false statements in the case of non-referring statements.

\subsubsection*{Indefinite Descriptions}
In contrast to a definite description, an indefinite description is the subject of a sentence represented in the form ``an $F$'', again where $F$ is a noun-phrase or a singular, common noun.\\

When an indefinite description is used in a declarative statement, such as ``an $F$ is $G$'' the statement being considered is again just a logical conjunction. The difference between an indefinite and a definite description has to do with the second claim of a definite description; that is, the uniqueness claim. An indefinite description is not a single, unique individual or object, but rather a collection of individuals or objects which satisfy the two predicates.\\

This is expressed symbolically as: $\exists x.(Fx \land Gx)$.

\section{Theory of Types}
A type theory is a tractable syntactic formal system for proving the absence of certain behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they allow.\footnote{Benjamin C. Pierce} Bertrand Russell was among those who first devised such a system, his primary motivation was to remove paradoxes which arose from the naive set theory which Gottlob Frege had presented. According to the type theory Russell put forward, objects of a given type are built exclusively from objects of preceding types (those lower in the hierarchy), this prevented the possible looping constructs which led to the paradoxes found in naive set theory. Further on, Alonzo Church also devised a theory of types, in which expressions of a language are classified into types, furthermore, the types of expressions restrict the ways in which the expressions can be combined.\\

As previously mentioned, types result when speaking of the \emph{structure} of some statement. When we need to quantify over some domain; either specifying an individual, particular element from the domain, or speaking generally about the entire domain. We implicitly see types everywhere we look; whether we realise it or not. Types are an incredibly natural way to provide an ``order'' for objects in reality. We say that a soccer-ball is a ball, yet a foot-ball is also a ball, and a tennis-ball too. This is an example of types; these three objects all inherit from the type ``ball'', and yet further they constitute their own types. This is a polymorphic object theory, and explains our natural thinking rather well.

\subsection{Object Types}
When we say an object \emph{is} a type, we are modelling a relationship between what a type allows, and what an object can do.

\subsubsection{Atomic Types}
Atomic types are the building blocks in our mental data structure for types.

\subsubsection{Abstract Types}
Abstract types are ``templates'' or blue-prints to be used later by concrete objects. This is the basis of inheritance, the ability to share behaviour over types. An abstract object has no equivalent in a physical world, they are simply concepts and cannot be instantiated.

\subsubsection{Monomorphic Types}
This is a single-typed value.

\subsubsection{Polymorphic Types}
This is a multi-typed value.

\subsection{Types in Language}
In the natural, English language, types are implicitly used in communication.

\subsubsection{Observational Statements}
These are statements of observations, such as ``this is a white swan.'' Logicians call these statements \emph{singular existential statements}, since they assert the existence of some particular thing. An observational statement is a statement regarding a definite article in Russellian terminology.

\subsubsection{Categorical Statements}
These are statements that categorize all instances of something, such as ``all swans are white''. Logicians call these statements \emph{universal}. A categorical statement is a statement regarding an indefinite article in Russellian terminology.

On Sense and Reference by Gottlob Frege: /Reading Notes/

#+AUTHOR: Matthew Ball
#+DATE: 2011

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Equality gives rise to challenging questions which are not altogether easy to answer. Is it a relation? A relation between objects, or between names or signs of objects?/[fn:1]
#+END_QUOTE

The two statements $a = a$ and $a = b$ have, obviously, different cognitive value; $a = a$ holds /a priori/ (and is therefore labelled /analytic/), while a statement of the form $a = b$ contains information which /extends/ our knowledge and cannot always be established from reason alone (i.e. /a priori/). If we take equality as a relation between those objects which the names '$a$' and '$b$' designate, it would appear that $a = b$ could not differ from $a = a$ in truth-value. Therefore, the relation would be /reflexive/ (i.e. the relation would be expressed of a thing to itself), one in which each thing stands to itself and no other. The notion which $a = b$ appears to /capture/ is that the two objects denoted by the signs (or names) '$a$' and '$b$' designate the /same/ thing.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/Let $a, b, c$ be the lines connecting the vertices of triangle with the midpoints of the opposite sides, The point of intersection of $a$ and $b$ is then the same as the point of intersection of $b$ and $c$. So we have different designations for the same point, and these names ('point of intersection of $a$ and $b$', 'point of intersection of $b$ and $c$') likewise indicate the mode of presentation; and hence the statement contains actual knowledge./[fn:2]
#+END_QUOTE

It is intuitive to think of a name as being connected to a referent of the sign; this is what Frege calls the /sense/ of a name. The mode of presentation is contained within this sign. In the example quoted above the /reference/ of the expressions 'the point of intersection of $a$ and $b$' and 'the point of intersection of $b$ and $c$' would be the same, but not their senses.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/The reference of 'the evening star' would be the same as that of 'the morning star' but not their sense./[fn:3]
#+END_QUOTE

In this analysis, Frege has used the 'sign' (or 'name') of an object to designate a /proper name/, whose reference is always a /definite object/[fn:4]

To each sign there corresponds a single (definite) sense, and to that sense, in turn, a single (definite) reference. While to a given reference (an object), there may exist more than one sign - the /same/ sense has different expressions (representations) in different languages (or even the same language).

Not every sense has a reference.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/The words 'the celestial body most distant from the Earth' have a sense, but it is very doubtful if they also have a reference. The expression 'the least rapidly convergent series' has a sense but demonstrably has no reference./[fn:5]
#+END_QUOTE

In grasping a sense, there is no guarantee the aforementioned sense does in fact have a reference.

In ordinary, colloquial, language (i.e. words are used in the "ordinary" way) what a speaker usually intends to speak of is the reference. However, we /can/ talk about the sense of each word, this is done by quoting. We have here signs of signs.

Frege makes the distinction between using words /indirectly/ (in which they have an /indirect/ reference) and /customary/ use and reference of a word. The indirect reference of a word is its customary sense.

The reference and sense of a sign are to be distinguished from the associated /idea/. When the reference of a sign is an object manifest in the sense, the idea is an /internal image/ (influenced by previous sense-impressions an individual possesses and the acts, both internal and external, which they have performed). This idea is often contained with emotional attachment; such that the same idea is not always connected (even in the same individual) with the same sense. Thus, the idea is /subjective/, but the sense is /objective/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
/A proper name (word, sign, sign combination, expression) expresses its sense, stands for or designates its reference. By means of a sign we express its sense and designate its reference./[fn:6]
#+END_QUOTE



According to Frege, /sense/ and /reference/ are two different aspects of the meaning of at least some kinds of terms.

Roughly, a term's reference is the object it refers to and its sense is the way in which it refers to that object.

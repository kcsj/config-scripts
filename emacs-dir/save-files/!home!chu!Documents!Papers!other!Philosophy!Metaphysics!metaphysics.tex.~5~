\section{Introduction}
The central theme of this paper regards an ontology of objects and types; a study of the nature of conception and abstraction.\\

The main thesis put forward here is a platonic, neo-Fregean view concerning the existence of abstract objects. This is perhaps a view subscribed to by an advocate of a \emph{neo-logicist} ontological metaphysics (in particular, philosophy of mathematics).

\subsection{Numbers and Sets}
To reason about sets of elements, we first need the ability to reason about numbers, else we are in a sort of conundrum where the only set we can talk about is the empty set. To even say ``there is this set with a single element $x$'' we need to understand just what is meant by the notion of ``single''.

\subsection{Existential Assertion}
When an individual asserts, for instance ``the unicorn was elegant'', if we are to strip this into the classical \emph{subject-predicate} form, then what is the object that the subject of such a sentence refers to? Surely in some sense, when someone hears this being uttered it conjures in their mind the image of a horse with a horn on its head. Despite the fact that no \emph{real} unicorns exist in our physical reality, we have here a conceptual representation of what a unicorn is. If we are able to \emph{describe} what a unicorn is, does this imply that a unicorn exists, manifest in some \emph{possible} entity?\\

When we state an existential fact, we have in mind some \emph{definite} object by way of a description. Existence is a property of propositional functions; it is not a property of things.

\subsection{Universal Assertion}
\emph{Something about what universal assertions consist of ...}\\

When we state a universal fact, we have in mind some \emph{indefinite} concept by way of a description.

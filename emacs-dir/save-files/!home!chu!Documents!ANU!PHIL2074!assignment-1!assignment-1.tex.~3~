%% \emph{Outline Coherentist and Foundationalist accounts of the structure of justified belief.  Which is the more plausible?}

\section{Introduction}
This essay will attempt to explain just what is meant by the concept of ``justified belief'', before analysing this notion from two opposing points of reference; that of a \emph{Foundationalist} and that of a \emph{Coherentist}. In contemporary epistemology, these two positions play the dominant role in a theory of \emph{how} knowledge is constructed from the beliefs of an individual.\\

The objective of the analysis of knowledge is to state the conditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for propositional knowledge: knowledge that such-and-such is the case. Propositional knowledge must be distinguished from two other kinds of knowledge that fall outside the scope of this analysis: knowing a place or a person, and knowing how to do something.\\

The traditional formulation of propositional knowledge (in Western philosophy) involves three key components: justification, truth, and belief. Propositional knowledge is, in this tradition, a \emph{justified belief held about a truth}. To elaborate, the formulation holds that three conditions are necessary, and jointly sufficient for ``knowledge''. First, belief: you do not know something unless you also hold it as true in your mind; if you do not believe it, then you do not know it. Second, truth: there can be no knowledge of false propositions; belief in a falsehood is delusion or misapprehension, not knowledge. Third, justification: the belief must be appropriately supported; there must be sufficient evidence for the belief.\\

\subsection{Foundationalist}
Foundationalism is a view concerning the structure of justification or knowledge. The foundationalist's thesis in short is that all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of non-inferential knowledge (that is, not based on interpretation; directly expressed) or justified belief. A foundationalist adheres to the claim that there are certain ``axiomatic'' beliefs (self-evident truths) from which \emph{all} other beliefs of an individual can be built upon (and in this way, the individual is justified in believing); self-evident basic beliefs justify other non-basic beliefs.\\

Traditionally, Foundationalism has its roots in Descartes' ``Meditations on Philosophy''\footnote{Insert Reference ...}\\

\subsection{Coherentist}
Coherentism is a view concerning the structure of justification or knowledge. The coherentist's thesis is normally formulated in terms of a denial of its contrary foundationalism. Coherentism thus claims, minimally, that not all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of non-inferential knowledge or justified belief. A coherentist believes that each belief rests upon another (perhaps ``stronger'') belief; beliefs are justified if they cohere with other beliefs a person holds, each belief is justified if it coheres with the overall system of beliefs.\\

The notion of a Coherentist approach to how knowledge is formed from beliefs is proposed in Quine's seminal work ``Two Dogmas of Empiricism''\footnote{Insert Reference ...}\\

List of Files:

+ /etc/apt/sources.list    -> ~/Backup/sources.list
+ /etc/fstab		   -> ~/Backup/fstab

+ ~/.screenrc	     -> ~/Backup/screenrc ...
+ ~/.bashrc	     -> ~/Backup/bashrc   ...
+ ~/.muttrc          -> ~/Backup/muttrc   ...
+ ~/.irssi/config    -> ~/Backup/irssi    ...

======
To Do:
======
- Create a new ~/Backup/archives/ dir --?
- Backup /var/cache/apt/archives      --?
- ~/ssh2partch -> ~/Backup/ssh2partch --?

======================================
Configuration Setup - ~/.conf-scripts/
======================================
- This will allow me to put all my config files on github (not necessarily a backup procedure)

- Create ~/.conf-scripts/ directory
- Move config files to ~/.conf-scripts/
- Provide (produce automatically, with a bash script) symlinks from ~/.conf-scripts/ directory to appropriate locations

- Symlink command is: "cd; ln -s .conf-scripts/bashrc .bashrc"

- List of files to move are:
+ ~/.emacs           -> ~/.conf-scripts/emacs    (then symlink back to ~/.emacs)
+ ~/.bashrc          -> ~/.conf-scripts/bashrc   (then symlink back to ~/.bashrc)
+ ~/.screenrc        -> ~/.conf-scripts/screenrc (then symlink back to ~/.screenrc)
+ ~/.muttrc          -> ~/.conf-scripts/muttrc   (then symlink back to ~/.muttrc)
+ ~/.irssi/config    -> ~/.conf-scripts/irssi    (then symlink back to ~/.irssi/config)
+ ~/.aptitude/config -> ~/.conf-scripts/aptitude (then symlink back to ~/.aptitude/config)

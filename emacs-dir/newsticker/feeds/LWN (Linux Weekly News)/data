Vint Cerf is widely credited as one of the creators of the Internet.
So, when he stood up at linux.conf.au in Brisbane to say that the net is
currently in need of some \"serious evolution,\" the attendees were more than
prepared to listen.  According to Vint, it is not too late to create a
better Internet, despite the fact that we have missed a number of
opportunities to update the net's infrastructure.  Quite a few problems
have been discovered over the years, but the solutions are within our

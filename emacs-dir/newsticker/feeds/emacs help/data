Thanks for your help. I'm glad you were at least able to reproduce the problem. I'll try experimenting with removing things from my .emacs file to see if that makes a difference.
BTW, sounds like our monitors display the grey a little differently. My second monitor is much lighter, but my macbook pro seems dark. The green or magenta text on a grey background is virtually unreadable.

As mentioned by others, the [[ ]] indicate emacs is in a recursive edit
state. There are numerous things that can cause this, some indicating
problems and others which are not so bad. For example, if you have many
frames open and you do something that causes emacs to start the debugger
and you are put into a backtrace, but then you change to another
window/frame without quitting the debugger and continue doing some other
work, such as reading your mail, you will likely see that emacs is in a
recursive edit.
One way that may help to track down the point at which the recursive
session starts is to close all windows and frames except 1, then hit the
escape key 3 times. Note the window and what is happening now. This will
often represent the point at which emacs was in just prior to the start
of the last recursive edit. If you still have [ ] in the modeline, hit
escape another 3 times and note where you are at. Again, this should

I've tried to customise paragraph-separate to \"[ \\t]*\\(%.*\\)?$\" and
similar regexps but this does not help.
Can anyone help me with this?
Many thanks in advance!

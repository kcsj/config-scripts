* BASH Configuration
- the bash configuration is split over three files:
  1. bashrc :: the bash rc file
  2. bash\_aliases :: the bash alias definition file
  3. bash\_functions :: the bash functions definition file

  + the current configuration includes a bash config for:
    1. Debian
    2. Ubuntu
    3. Arch
